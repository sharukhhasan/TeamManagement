# TeamManagement

Android application which allows a user to create an account and log in. A user can add, edit, or delete a row of what he/she has worked on. Along with the user role the application also has two higher level roles, managers and admins. A manager can assign users to his list and change user data. Admin's can change managers and users data. Admin's can also generate time reports. Developed this application to simplify project team work.
